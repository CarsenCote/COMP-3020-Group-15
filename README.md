# COMP-3020-Group-15
The git repository for the final project of COMP-3020-Group-15

## Task Management
Tasks for us to work on are divided into major "milestones", with each different page being its own milestone. Anybody can create a new task and add a description, which should include expected functionality or major elements for us to add to a page. 

Tasks will be "first come first serve"; anybody can throw their name on a task to show they intend to complete it.

## Pull Requests
PRs will be reviewed by at least one other group member before merging into the main branch. This is to reduce the risk of merge conflicts and ensure our code is being properly tested and that a PR has accomplished what it set out to (i.e. fulfilled a specific task requirement).
